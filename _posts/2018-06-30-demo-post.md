## Welcome!

I'm Chaitanya, a dynamic professional with a keen focus on analytics and data-driven decision-making. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Management at Purdue University's Daniels School of Business, with an expected graduation in August 2024. My academic and professional foundations are rooted in a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

My career has spanned roles that intersect data analysis, product management, and business strategy, equipping me with a diverse skill set that ranges from technical proficiencies in Python, MySQL, and Tableau to strategic expertise in agile and waterfall methodologies. I thrive in environments that challenge my analytical and problem-solving capabilities and enjoy turning complex data into actionable business insights.

Professionally, I've had the opportunity to work with leading organizations such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wooqer, where I honed my skills in process optimization and data-driven decision-making. At Ascent Cyber Solutions â€“ Innoveo Ag, I led the development and deployment of Skye software applications on a low-code platform, significantly enhancing project delivery efficiencies and reducing operational costs by streamlining development processes.

My academic accomplishments include securing first place in the SAS Optimization Challenge, showcasing my ability to address real-world problems with innovative solutions that demonstrate minimal deviation from optimal thresholds. This recognition is a testament to my dedication and meticulous approach to business challenges.

I am also deeply committed to community and leadership roles, having served as a district leader in initiatives aimed at improving public sanitation and as a president of cultural events at university, promoting cultural diversity and inclusion.

When I'm not analyzing data or leading projects, you might find me in the garden talking to my plants about data trends or in the kitchen trying to figure out if my cooking skills can be optimized with a sprinkle of analytics.

As I continue to evolve professionally, I seek opportunities to leverage my analytical skills and business acumen to drive impactful changes in technology and business operations. I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore potential collaborations that push the boundaries of what we can achieve with data and analytics.
