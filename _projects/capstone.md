excerpt: This project examines the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) in enhancing financial analysis through metric extraction by combining Large Language Models (LLM), NLP, and other advanced techniques like vectorization and RAG. Due to the complex and time-intensive nature of traditional financial analysis, there is a pressing need for more automated solutions and less human interventions. Our research utilized web scraping to gather data (SEC filings), NLP techniques for data content pre-processing, embeddings & vector search for relevant content retrieval, and LLM models on Vertex AI for information extraction from the given context. We also implemented techniques like rephrasing raw user queries to add additional context, chunking of data in batches considering models input token limits, tokenization, and one-shot prompting to enhance the method described above. The primary aim was to streamline the process, minimize human error, and provide personalized information through a novel AI assistant-style tool. The result is a chatbot tool that serves as an AI assistant, enabling users to navigate financial queries and extract meaningful insights with ease. This study highlights the transformative potential of Gen AI in financial analysis, catering to the demand for timely and accessible financial insights in a data-intensive market.â€¯
